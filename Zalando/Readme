Zalando is an e-commerce site. I worked with the WiseX team on this project. I worked as a UX auditor.

Not all the files are shared here due to privacy and policy concerns. Only a few of the works are shown in this repository.
I worked on the sitemap, personas, user journey, etc. I also helped them with the design decision using research and UX principles.
